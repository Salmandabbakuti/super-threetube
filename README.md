> Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the environment variables with your own values.

```bash

npm install

npx hardhat compile

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network scrollSepolia

```

2. Deploying the Subgraph

> Create new subgraph in TheGraph studio and update package.json `deploy` script with your subgraph id. Update `subgraph/subgraph.yaml` with your contract address and block number.

```bash
cd subgraph

npm install

npm run deploy
```

### 3. Running the Frontend
