# Hardhat Boilerplate(Minimal)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts with balances.

## Getting Started

> Recommended to use Node.js v18+ and npm v8+

> Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values as needed

Try running some of the following tasks:

```bash
npm install

# starts local node
npx hardhat node

# compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# deploy contract in scripts/deploy.ts on specified network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost

# verify contract
npx hardhat verify --network <deployed network> <deployed contract address> "<constructor1>" "<constructor2>"

# check coverage using solidity-coverage plugin: supports hardhat network only
npx hardhat coverage --network hardhat

# unit tests including gas usage
npx hardhat test

# remove all compiled and deployed artifacts
npx hardhat clean

# show help
npx hardhat help
```
